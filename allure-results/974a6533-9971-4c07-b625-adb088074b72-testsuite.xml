                <message>Timed out after waiting `60000ms` for your remote page to load.
                
                Your page did not fire its `load` event within `60000ms`.
                
                You can try increasing the `pageLoadTimeout` value in `cypress.config.js` to wait longer.
                
                Browsers will not fire the `load` event until all stylesheets and scripts are done downloading.
                
                When this `load` event occurs, Cypress will continue running commands.
                
                Because this error occurred during a `before each` hook we are skipping the remaining tests in the current suite: `Waiting`</message>
